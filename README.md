# Interactive-Day-Planner
Creating a interactive work day planner using day.js and jquery.

## Instructions
To use source code to help make a daily planner for a standard 9-5 work schedule. When the planner is open the current date and time will be displayed at the top. When you scroll down there should be time blocks for each hour and should be color coded based on if the current time is in the past, present, or future. When you enter a event and click the save button it should be saved in the local storage so when the page is refreshed the events will persist in the selected time block

### Results 
I developed a daily planner that shows the current time and date. I created time blocks for the possible events during the day and they're color coded with grey as the past, red as the present, and green as the future. When you enter a event into a time block you can then click the save button and it will save into the time block field via local storage and will persist in the field when refreshed until a new event is stored.
